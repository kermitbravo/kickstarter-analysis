## Overview of the Project

For this project we aimed to help Louise undertake the launch of a play and potentially future musicals by leveraging Kickstarter data. The main objective was to help her make important decisions to maximize the possibilities of having a successful outcome for her campaign. For this we will be leveraging statistical analysis along with visual aids to identify trends and provide a recommendation to Louise based on the outcome of previous campaigns. This data contains information collected internationally over the period of 7 years (from 2010 - 2017).

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis


### Challenge

The main challenge that we encountered was that with the data collected and during this period of time selected, there were no cancelled campaigns specific to Theater/Plays. Because of this, we couldn't collect potential reasons why a cancellation of a campaign might happen or any other relevant parameters. This could mean that these types of campaings either fail or succeed but we can't say for sure with the data collected. 

### Taking a look at the outcome of Theater campaigns by month

### Digging a little deeper and looking at plays by outcome and goal
